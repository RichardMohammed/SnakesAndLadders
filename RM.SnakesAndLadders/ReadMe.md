# Snakes And Ladders C# Demo

Status: Work in progress

This demo can be used to test teh Snakes and ladders Kata 1 i.e being able to:
	- Roll a dice
	- Move player tokens 
	- Check for a winner

The demo program uses 2 constant player tokens named "Player 1" and "Player 2" 
but this can be enhanced to accept the number of players on game start.
There is also no GUI as I expect this is not necessary for this kata. 
The game is played by having each user use the ENter button to roll the dice and
thus advance their token.
